## About me 
I am a second-year PhD student in English at the University of Miami. My primary research intersts include disability studies, digital humanities, and contemporary poetry and new media. Prior to beginning my PhD, I worked as an educator in various K-12 settings. My current First-Year Writing course at the University of Miami is focused around [disability representation in the media](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gAPsGgOQXwm27klt54E6ZRhkXUorGHwwNogollGhmbU/edit?usp=sharing).
